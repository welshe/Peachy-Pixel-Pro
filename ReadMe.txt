Wplace Update Log

A simple HTML interface for writing text, designed to help you figure out how to write a specific letter/character, especially in a pixel art context.
ðŸš€ Version 1 Release - 26/09/2025

Massive Update! The initial release brings a huge set of features to enhance your pixel text creation:
Core Effects & Styling

    Text Shadow Effect: Adds a shadow behind the pixel text for depth and emphasis. The shadow can be toggled on/off and automatically applies when saving to PNG or SVG.

    Gradient Text: Applies a gradient color effect to the text instead of a solid color. You can choose the start and end colors of the gradient.

    Text Outline: Adds an outline around each pixel in the text. You can customize the outline color to make your text stand out.

    Text Effects: Combines multiple effects like shadow, outline, and animations to create unique text styles.

    Color Palette: Includes a gradient preview that shows how your gradient colors will look when applied to the text.

Layout & Transformation

    Text Rotation: Allows rotating the entire pixel grid by 90Â°, 180Â°, or 270Â°. This is useful for creating vertical text or special effects.

    Text Mirroring: Provides options to flip text horizontally, vertically, or both. This creates mirror images of your text for creative effects.

    Text Alignment: Provides options to align your text left, center, or right within the grid.

Dynamic & Backgrounds

    Animation Effects: Provides different animation types (wave, pulse, glow) that can be applied to individual pixels for dynamic effects.

    Background Patterns: Offers different background patterns (dots, grid, diagonal) to enhance the visual appeal of your pixel art.

Customization & Workflow

    Custom Character Editor: Enables you to create your own 5x7 pixel characters that can be used in your text.

    Pixel Art Gallery: Provides a gallery of pre-made pixel art (heart, smile, star, etc.) that can be inserted into your text.

    Text History: Keeps a history of your last 10 generated texts, allowing you to easily go back to previous work.

    Batch Processing: Allows processing multiple texts at once, generating pixel art for each line of text in a batch.

Saving & Usability

    Export as SVG: Allows saving your pixel art as an SVG file, which is a vector format that can be scaled without losing quality.

    Export as JSON: Saves all your settings and custom characters as a JSON file, which can be loaded later to restore your work.

    Import from JSON: Loads previously saved JSON files to restore your work, including all settings and custom characters.

    Keyboard Shortcuts: Adds convenient keyboard shortcuts for common actions like generating text (Ctrl+Enter), saving (Ctrl+S), inverting colors (Ctrl+I), and more.

    Fullscreen Mode: Allows viewing your pixel art in fullscreen mode for a better viewing experience.

    Auto-save: Automatically saves your work to local storage, so you won't lose your progress if you accidentally close the page.
